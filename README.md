## PWA test app 

This is Tyler's attempt to deploy a simple CRA created webapp that will function as a PWA.  

This environment using CRA's manifest and service worker will be the ground zero for figuring this out.  

Using Netlify will enable a very fast deployment and hosting process to test for the app's usability on mobile and desktop and allow for quick iterations in development.
